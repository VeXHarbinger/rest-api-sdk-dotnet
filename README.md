The repository contains the PayPal PaymentSDK C#.NET Class Library Application and the PaymentSDKUnitTest C#.NET Visual Studio Test Application.

I have only updated the commenting aspect of the SDK to enhance the Intelesense.


When you download the PayPal.RestAPI.SDK.Documentation.chm file, remember to right click on it and select properties.
Then click the unblock button in the bottom right hand corner of the window.
After that you will be able to view the documentation.
